Maybe the doctor's friends took all of the unhealthy Malas to the space castle. That is a good idea because we cannot have them turn into a monster like Susan.#She is an example of what would happen if we Malas continue to breath the bad air. Can you imagine the destruction that would happen if some mad Mala found a way to use that stuff in the air against us!#I am beginning to feel weak. Turning in to a yellow color is only a matter of time. I wish the doctor would hurry and find a cure. The potions only delay the bad effects. Maybe the doctor has the cure and that is the reason why he took all the unhealthy Malas away.#@
