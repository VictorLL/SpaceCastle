Thank you for finding my dog. One more dog to find.#Do you know that the doctor and his friends are not from this planet? Soon after their arrival, they talked about medicine with the Malas. The conclusion was the doctor and his friends were a lot more superior in medicine practices than the Malas.#The doctor soon opened a laboratory. The doctor or one of his friends were mixing some chemicals. Hoping to rid the common cold from the Malas, the chemicals were added to the common cold virus but something went wrong. The virus of the smallest of size was seen through the microscope as mutated with many of teeth.#Please find my last dog to hear the rest of the story.#@
