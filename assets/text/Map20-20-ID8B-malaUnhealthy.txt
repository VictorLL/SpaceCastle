Susan is a monster? Now I know why the doctor was so hasty to see her. If a Mala is very sick then turning in to a monster will soon be the result. She needed to consume a potion to delay that effect!#The potion is not the cure. It is only consumed to delay the sickness of a Mala. The doctor is still working on a cure.@
