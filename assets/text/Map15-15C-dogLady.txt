Thank you for your help in finding my dogs.#So, the doctor and his friends, not from this planet, were not affected by the mutated virus. The virus, now using them as a host, was soon outside of the laboratory. The virus quickly became airborne. #The doctors plans to improve the Malas health was now the result of their sickness. The mutated virus was unstoppable. Most Malas still to this day do not know about that truth. They merely say that we Malas are sick because of something in the bad air.#Fearing that the bad air would turn all Malas soon into monsters, the doctor searched for a cure. He believes that many flowers from the grass weeds would bring the sick Malas, the monsters, back to normal health.#Only time will tell the fate of the Malas.#@
