I have made a cure potion from the grass weed flowers. The potion should cure both the Malas and hopefully the Mala monsters by destroying the virus.#Oh, I am the doctor. I put the Malas into the cages so that they would not hurt one another. We would not want a raging Mala monster loose at the town. Once I am at the cages, I will teleport all of them to the waiting room at the hospital.#Hopefully I can cure then all simultaneously. I am taken a risk that a Mala might turn in to a monster at the waiting room but I need them all there since my equipment is near to that place. I see that you are sick from the virus. I am teleporting you to the waiting room now.#@
